The C++ String Toolkit (StrTk) Library is a free library that consists of robust, optimized and portable generic string processing algorithms and procedures for the C++ language. The library is designed to be easy to use and integrate within existing code.

The library has the following capabilities:

  * Generic string tokenizer and token iterators
  * Fast Split routines
  * User specified delimiter and splitter policies (simple and regex based etc.)
  * Conversions between data and hex and base-64
  * In-place removal and replace routines
  * Wild-card matching and globbing
  * Search and Replace
  * Fast token grid and Comma Separated Values (CSV) processing
  * Extremely fast String to Integer, Double and other POD conversions
  * Extensible string processing templates and algorithms (eg: combinatorics and randomizations)
  * Fast and simple-to-use binary serialization
  * Seamless integration with STL and Boost
  * Easy to use wrappers of common string processing usage patterns
  * Single header file solution requires no installation or building

and plenty more...
